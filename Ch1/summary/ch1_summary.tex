\section {{\large{\textbf{The Fundamental Concepts of Quantum Mechanics}}}}

\subsection {Probability in Quantum Mechanics}

With the birth of quantum mechanics, the wave-particle confusion of light came to an end. This new theory is fundamentally unpredictable and all we can do is compute probabilities of different outcomes. Even more fundamental was the discovery that laws of nature don't obey classical probability theory of Laplace.
